	These files are meant to be viewed with Tinke. I don't want to give the link because I don't want to be accused of any copyrights or anything. Just find a version of Tinke that can view nclr, ncgr, ncer, nanr, nbfp, nbfc, and nbfs files. That may require plugins to work.

* For the Nsbmd Models, use MKDS Course Modifier. It's much better for models.


* If you want to make an animated dae file using nsbmd + nsbca, you can download apicula. Just type it in and it should be easy to find.

* I also included the FILESYSTEM of the original DK Jungle Climber in case anyone wants to explore that. The nbfc's need to be decompressed. The nbfs's also can be decompressed starting at offset 0x4.


Please let me know if you have any trouble.
